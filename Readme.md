# gcdemos

Various demos for GAMECUBE that I make when I'm bored.

Without any particular purpose, just for fun.

## Build

The build requires a full or partially installed Dolphin SDK, in the default directory (`C:/DolphinSDK`), and CodeWarrior for GAMECUBE.

Then the .mcp files of the projects are opened in CW and the build is started by the IDE.
